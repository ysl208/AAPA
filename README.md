# Action-aware Perceptual Anchoring (AAPA)

This is an implementation of the paper [Maintaining a Reliable World Model using Action-aware Perceptual Anchoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03038).

AAPA is a rule-based approach that considers inductive biases to perform high-level reasoning over the results from low-level object detection and improves the robot's perceptual capability for complex tasks. It can handle object detection errors, out of view, and more complex scenarios such as invisible displacements by considering agent actions.
